## FIRMWARE v3.2.1
This section explains how the controller works and how pressing individual switches or different switch combinations will interact with the controller.

Please refer to the Midi Type Glossary as well for more information on selecting the correct midi type that you need.

## Overview

The MC6 is a fully programmable Midi controller. How it is structured is simple: There are 30 banks. Each bank has 12 presets, 6 of which are accessible from the 6 switches, while the other 6 are hidden but can be activated by other means such as dual switch presses or external controllers. A Page Toggle function is also available to flip between the first 6 presets and the last 6 presets.

Each preset can be programmed to send out 16 different messages. Please refer to the Midi Types Glossary for the full list of messages available to you.

We take pride in making the MC6 one of the easiest-to-use programmable Midi controllers in the market. If there is any questions you have using the device, please do not hesitate to drop us an email at help@morningstarfx.com.


â€‹## TL;DR
Too long, didn't read! Cause who likes reading manuals, right?

While we encourage you to go through the full manual, here's a quick list of information to get you quickly started. We take pride in making the MC6 as easy to use as possible, and hope that the on-board directions will be intuitive to you.

Press Switch [D + F] in the main preset page. The last used preset, expression pedal input and bank will be displayed in the menu.

### Editing your presets in the editor
Make sure you are in Editor mode. Press Switch [C + D] to enter editor mode. Make sure to exit Editor mode to have the full functionality available before you use it with your devices.

## Powering the MC6
How to power your MC6

### 9VDC Centre Negative power supply
Connect a 9VDC centre negative power supply to the power input of the MC6.

### Phantom Power (9-12v AC or DC)
Connect a 7-pin Midi cable to the MIDI OUT port of the MC6. Phantom power is supplied through pins 6 and 7. Phantom power is chained to pins 6 & 7 on the MIDI IN port as well, allowing you to power other devices.

If sending DC power, the polarity does not matter.

### USB powered
Connect a USB cable to the MC6. The MC6 is capable of being fully powered by USB.

## Connections and I/Os

### Midi In/Receive
This is where the MC6 receives MIDI messages from other MIDI devices.

The MC6 passes incoming MIDI messages via the MIDI In/Receive port out to the USB port, and vice versa.

### Midi Out/Send/Thru
This is where MIDI data is sent from the MC6 to other devices. You can use a standard 5-pin MIDI cable, or a 7-pin one if you want to power the MC6 with phantom power. The MC6 also has MIDI THRU, which allows incoming MIDI messages to be relayed to other MIDI-capable devices.

### USB port
The MC6 can also send and receive MIDI data via USB, allowing you to have control over your DAWs and music software. It is class compliant and compatible with Windows, macOS, Android and iOS.

The MC6 passes incoming MIDI messages via the MIDI In/Receive port out to the USB port, and vice versa.

### EXP 1 & 2
Connect your expression pedals to these ports. You may also connect aux switches to add more programmable switches to the MC6. 

Please note that these ports are INPUT only, and cannot be using to control functions like amp switching or sending Control Voltage messages. You should only be connecting an expression pedal or TRS Aux Switches to these ports.
