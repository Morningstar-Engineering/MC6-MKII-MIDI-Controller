Empty Message Description No data will be sent out. Program Change Description Sends a Program Change message of a specified number and channel. Program Change messages are usually used to call presets or patches in your Midi devices. Example of Use Activate a preset/patch on your Midi Device. Control Change Description Sends a Control Change message of a specified number, value and channel. Control Change messages are usually used to change function parameters or call functions in your Midi devices. Example of Use To activate the record function on the Strymon Timeline, send a CC#87 with any value. (Refer to Timeline Manual) Note On Description Sends a Midi Note On Message. Note Off Description Sends a Midi Note Off Message. Real Time Description Sends a Midi Real Time message. Choose from Start, Stop or Continue SysEx Description Sends a Midi System Exclusive message. The first value is always the length of the SysEx array, followed by the values you want to send. The values are in decimal (base10) format and not in hex. The values are spread across multiple messages. For example, if the length of your SysEx message is 5 and the message you want to send out is {0, 4, 25, 54, 23}, you will need to use 2 messages for this SysEx message where: Msg 1 * P1/Length = 5 * P2 = 0 * P3 = 4 Msg 2 * P1/Length = 25 * P2 = 54 * P3 = 23 The actions assigned to each message must match. For example, if your SysEx message requires using 3 messages on the MC6, the 3 messages need to have the same action i.e. Press. The length should not include the SysEx start and end bytes (i.e. 0xF0 and 0xF7). Midi Clock Tap Tempo Description Sends a Midi Clock signal to out from USB and 5 Pin Midi. Syncs your Midi Clock enabled devices to a common BPM. You can set the tempo in the parameters, and then choose if you want the device to show the tap menu. If selected, the MC6 will load the tap tempo screen when the preset is activated. If not selected, the MC6 will send out the Midi Clock messages according to the preset tempo. When another event occurs i.e. a switch is pressed or expression is moved, the Midi Clock messages will stop. PC Scroll Up Description Sends an incremental message each time the preset is activated. There are 8 counters in the MC6 internal memory. The Select Slot parameter selects one of this counters for your PC Scroll message. Hence, each time the preset is activated, the MC6 will send a PC message which number is based on that counter. The Increment parameter determines if the counter will be increased each time the preset is engaged. The Lower Limit and Upper Limit parameters lets you set a range where the counter will scroll between. Let's go through this scenario: If you are trying to scroll through 2 devices (on channel 1 & 2) at the same time with the same preset, first select a counter you want to use. In this example, let's set Select Slot to 1 for Msg1. Increment should be set to Yes, since we want the counter to increase (only for the first message). Thereafter, set your lower and upper limit and channel. For Msg2, select the same slot number as Msg1. Increment should be set to No, since the first message already increased the counter once. PC Scroll Down Description Similar to PC Scroll Up, but counter is decreased instead of increase. Bank Up Description Changes to the next bank on the MC6. Bank Down Description Changes to the previous bank on the MC6. Bank Change Mode Description Puts the MC6 into a state where you can scroll up and down banks with dedicated switches and then select the bank you want to use. Set Bank Description Jumps to another bank on the MC6. Toggle Page Description Toggle between pages in a bank. In the main page, the main switches control Presets A-F. By toggling to the next page, Presets G-L are brought forward to the main page where their preset names will be displayed on the screen, and you can control them with the main switches. Set Toggle Description Changes the toggle state of your presets.You can choose whether to \"Set\" or \"Clear\" the toggle positions. \"Set\" will engage the preset, while \"Clear\" will disengage it. You can select the presets to apply this change to. MIDI Thru Description Sets the global Midi Thru feature on the MC6 on or off. Select Expression Message Description You can select individual messages in each expression preset to be active with this function. There are 16 messages in each expression preset. If, for example, you set Msg1 and Msg2 to be active on Expression 1, each time you move your expression pedal in Exp1 input, only Msg1 and Msg2 will be sent out. This setting is global and applied to all banks. It will be reset to all active when the device power cycles. Looper Mode Description This message toggles in and out of Looper mode. Looper mode basically increase the sensitivity of your switches to the maximum, so that messages sent out are instantaneous. This is useful if you are using the MC6 to control time-sensitive functions such as Record/Play/Stop. In firmware v3.2 onwards, instead of Toggle on/off, we added a selection to allow users to select whether they want to Toggle or set Looper Mode to On or Off. Strymon Bank Up Description Bank up on your Strymon Timeline, M\u00f6bius and Bigsky Strymon Bank Down Description Bank down on your Strymon Timeline, M\u00f6bius and Bigsky AxeFX Tuner Description Upon engagement, the MC6 will send a CC#15 message with value 127 to the selected channel. CC#15 controls the tuner function on the AxeFX. After which, the tuner page will load. Upon exit, the MC6 will send a CC#15 message with value 0 to disengage the AxeFX tuner. Things to note Turn off Midi Thru on your AxeFX. Enable SysEx send on your AxeFX. Connect your AxeFX Midi out to the MC6 Midi In Toggle Preset Description This setting toggles a Preset between positions 1 and 2, and can be useful if you want to toggle a Preset with a specific action. Things to note To use this, be sure to leave the Preset-level toggle setting off.

Edit Type Parameters Depending the Midi Type that is selected in the previous menu, unique parameter edit menus will be loaded. Edit your parameters and then press Save on the last page to save your settings. Setting up a Toggle Message How to toggle between two different messages on your MC6 MKII. Using the Web/Desktop Editor Setting up a toggle message is easy. On the editor, there is a toggle option on the top left of the interface. Switch it to On to enable toggling for the preset. How it works Each preset on the MC6 allows you to toggle between two positions: 1 and 2. By default, the presets are on toggle position 1. If you switch the toggle to On, each time the preset is engaged, it will toggle to the other position (between 1 and 2). Each message also has a position option, where it will be sent out only when the position of the message matches that of the preset. Hence, if you set Msg1 to be a CC message in Pos 1, and Msg2 to be a CC Message in Pos 2, and you have your toggle on for the preset, each press will toggle between Msg 1 and Msg 2. Toggle Name When the preset is in position 1, the Short Name will be displayed. When the preset is in position 2, the Toggle Name will be displayed. Blinking To indicate that the preset is in position 2, you can also use the blink option, where if the blink option is set to On, the Toggle Name on the main page will blink when the preset is in position 2. Using the built-in MC6 editor After going into the preset edit menu, go to Page 3 of the menu. The Toggle button toggles between Toggle On and Toggle Off position for the preset, which the Blink button toggles between Blink On and Blink Off position for the preset. When editing individual messages, there will be an option to select the toggle position for the message you are editing. Choose between position 1 or 2 accordingly. Editing Expression Messages To edit expression messages, press switch D + F first, which will bring you to the edit page, and then select the expression option. Expression Edit Menu (Page 1) The first page of the menu for editing Expression Messages are the same as that for editing Preset Messages. Expression Edit Menu (Page 2) On the second page, you have the option to edit the Full Name, Sensitivity or calibrate your expression pedal. Edit Full Name When the expression pedal is being used, you have the option of displaying a Name for your expression preset. Simply edit and save the name to your expression preset. See Editing Names for more information after entering the FullName option in the Expression Edit Menu. Calibrating your Expression Input It is best to calibrate your expression pedal before use to get the optimum performance. Simply go into the Calibrate setting in your Expression Edit Menu. Once there, follow the instructions in the LCD. First set your expression pedal to a heel down position. Ideally, the value should be displayed as 0. Press Next. Next, set your expression pedal to a toe down position. Ideally, the value should be displayed as 127. Press Save to save your settings.

Using the Web/Desktop Editor Setting up a toggle message is easy. On the editor, there is a toggle option on the top left of the interface. Switch it to On to enable toggling for the preset. How it works Each preset on the MC6 allows you to toggle between two positions: 1 and 2. By default, the presets are on toggle position 1. If you switch the toggle to On, each time the preset is engaged, it will toggle to the other position (between 1 and 2). Each message also has a position option, where it will be sent out only when the position of the message matches that of the preset. Hence, if you set Msg1 to be a CC message in Pos 1, and Msg2 to be a CC Message in Pos 2, and you have your toggle on for the preset, each press will toggle between Msg 1 and Msg 2. Toggle Name When the preset is in position 1, the Short Name will be displayed. When the preset is in position 2, the Toggle Name will be displayed. Blinking To indicate that the preset is in position 2, you can also use the blink option, where if the blink option is set to On, the Toggle Name on the main page will blink when the preset is in position 2. Using the built-in MC6 editor After going into the preset edit menu, go to Page 3 of the menu. The Toggle button toggles between Toggle On and Toggle Off position for the preset, which the Blink button toggles between Blink On and Blink Off position for the preset.
